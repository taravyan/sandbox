Redesigning the site barwalt.com

This site could be improved in many ways. With a strong attention to design simplicity, accessibility, and good coding practices, I'll try to recreate the site with HTML and CSS to start. Later, improvements and embelishments could be made utilizing other forms of code.

I'm currently working my way through codecademy.com while I build this.
